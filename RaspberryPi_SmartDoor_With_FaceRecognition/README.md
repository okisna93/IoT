# Raspberry Pi Smart Door with Face Recognition

Introduction
In this project, I aim to reach to get rid of from metal key to open the door. In order to do that, I need a system that can recognize me and unlock the door. I used a raspberry pi with a camera module, which can run a face recognition algorithm. If the algorithm recognizes the face on the given list, the system automatically unlocks the door. If it can not recognize the face then the system keep the door locked.

# Introduction

In this project, I aim to open the door with a face recognition algorithm. I used a raspberry pi with a camera module. If the algorithm recognizes the face, the system automatically unlocks the door. If it can not recognize the face then the system keeps the door locked.

#  First Step

I started the project by completing the curcuit. After that , I wrote an algorithm which can unlock the door by using GPIO pins.

# Second Step

I wrote a script that can recognize faces that are in the ImageAttandence file. If I add any person's picture on that file, the person will be able to open the door.
